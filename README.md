README – Project Reflection: DriverPass
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was centered around developing a comprehensive web-based platform for a driving school service. The client aimed to streamline the process of enrolling in driving courses, accessing learning materials, and scheduling both written and practical exams. The goal was to design a user-friendly, scalable system that could serve both students and administrators, improving overall communication and operational efficiency.

What did you do particularly well?
One of my strongest contributions was in gathering and analyzing the client’s business requirements. I ensured that all user needs ranging from students' course access to administrative tracking features were clearly documented and translated into technical specifications. I also maintained consistent communication across mock stakeholder interactions, ensuring alignment between development progress and user expectations.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I had the opportunity to revise one part, I would enhance the user interface section of the system design document. Although the functional requirements were well detailed, I believe a more comprehensive wireframe and clearer user flow diagrams could better represent the user experience. Incorporating more visual elements would improve clarity for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
To interpret user needs effectively, I relied on user personas and user stories that highlighted the daily tasks and challenges faced by each role in the system. These insights were translated into system functionalities such as course selection, progress tracking, and automated notifications. Addressing user needs is critical in system design because it ensures the solution provides meaningful, intuitive, and value-driven features ultimately leading to higher user satisfaction and successful adoption.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
My approach to software design is iterative and user-focused. I begin with requirement gathering through stakeholder interviews, followed by modeling techniques such as use case diagrams, data flow diagrams, and wireframes to visualize the system. In the future, I plan to deepen my use of Agile methodologies and prototyping tools to gather early feedback, reduce rework, and align development efforts with evolving user needs. Additionally, I intend to place greater emphasis on usability testing and accessibility considerations during the design phase.
